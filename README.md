## About me ðŸ‘‹

With over 5 years of hands-on experience in IT services, cloud technologies, and automation, I am passionate about crafting robust and secure infrastructures that drive business success. My expertise lies in harnessing the power of AWS and Azure to deliver scalable solutions while integrating best practices in DevSecOps.

I stand out through my proven track record of collaborating with teams to deliver reliable and secure infrastructures. Certified in Azure, I bring a wealth of knowledge in automation with Ansible and Python, enabling streamlined processes and enhanced productivity. My dedication to staying updated with the latest technologies ensures that I can adapt quickly to new environments and tools, making me a valuable asset in dynamic IT landscapes.

I firmly believe in sharing knowledge and empowering others, which is why I have volunteered for several years to security conferences such as Wild West Hacking Fest (from Black Hills Information Security) and CactusCon.
